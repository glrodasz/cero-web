0Ô∏è‚É£ üöÄ **Cero a Producci√≥n** is a project of live coding sessions where we develop a a productivity management app called **RETO** from the scratch to production.

## The idea behind
The idea behind this sessions is to show a real developer experience where we explore every decision that a common programmer do in daily basis with JavaScript and other tools. You will see failing tests, refactors, Google and StackOverflow searchs, but also a lot of fun and the struggle of naming things.

Watch the project in live streaming in üá™üá∏ Spanish, from **Tuesdays** to **Fridays**. [![Twitch Status](https://img.shields.io/twitch/status/guillermorodas?style=social)](https://glrz.me/stream)
